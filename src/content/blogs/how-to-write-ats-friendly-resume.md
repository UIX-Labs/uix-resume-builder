If you've been applying to jobs online and hearing nothing back, there's a good chance your resume is being filtered out before a human ever sees it. The culprit? **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** — software that screens resumes before they reach a hiring manager.

In this guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know to create a resume that not only passes ATS screening but also impresses the recruiter on the other side.

## What Is an ATS and Why Does It Matter?

An Applicant Tracking System is software used by over **98% of Fortune 500 companies** and a growing number of small-to-mid-size businesses. It scans, parses, and ranks resumes based on criteria set by the employer.

Here's the hard truth: **up to 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS** before they're ever reviewed by a person. That means even highly qualified candidates get filtered out because of formatting issues, missing keywords, or incompatible file types.

### How ATS Software Works

1. **Parsing**: The ATS breaks your resume into sections — contact info, education, work experience, skills
2. **Keyword Matching**: It compares your content against the job description
3. **Ranking**: Candidates are scored and ranked based on relevance
4. **Filtering**: Only top-scoring resumes make it to the recruiter

## 10 Rules for an ATS-Friendly Resume

### 1. Use a Clean, Simple Format

ATS software struggles with complex layouts. Avoid:

- Multi-column designs
- Text boxes and graphics
- Headers and footers (some ATS can't read them)
- Tables for layout purposes
- Unusual fonts

**Stick to a single-column layout** with clearly defined sections and standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Georgia.

### 2. Use Standard Section Headings

ATS looks for specific section names. Use universally recognized headings:

| Instead of... | Use this |
|---|---|
| What I've Done | Work Experience |
| My Toolkit | Skills |
| Where I Studied | Education |
| My Story | Professional Summary |

### 3. Optimize for Keywords

This is the most critical step. **Mirror the language in the job description** — if the job posting says "project management," don't just write "managed projects."

Tips for keyword optimization:

- Read the job description carefully and highlight key terms
- Include both the spelled-out version and acronyms (e.g., "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)")
- Place keywords naturally in your experience descriptions, skills section, and summary
- Don't keyword-stuff — it needs to read naturally

### 4. Submit as a .docx or PDF

While PDFs preserve formatting, some older ATS systems struggle to parse them. Check the job posting for file type requirements. When in doubt, **.docx is the safest choice**.

Modern ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday handle PDFs well, but it's always good to test.

### 5. Include a Skills Section

Create a dedicated skills section with both **hard skills** and **soft skills** relevant to the role:

- **Hard skills**: Python, Data Analysis, Figma, Financial Modeling, SQL
- **Soft skills**: Cross-functional Collaboration, Strategic Planning, Team Leadership

### 6. Quantify Your Achievements

ATS may not score you higher for numbers, but recruiters will notice. Use specific metrics:

- "Increased sales by **35%** within Q3 through targeted outreach campaigns"
- "Reduced customer churn by **18%** by implementing a new onboarding flow"
- "Managed a portfolio of **$2.4M** in annual contracts"

### 7. Avoid Images and Graphics

ATS cannot read images, icons, or graphical elements. That includes:

- Profile photos
- Skill bar charts
- Icons for contact info
- Infographic-style layouts

Keep it text-based. Every piece of important information should be in actual text form.

### 8. Use Standard Date Formats

Consistency matters. Use a clear date format throughout:

- **Good**: January 2024 – Present, or 01/2024 – Present
- **Bad**: Jan '24 – now, or Since last year

### 9. Don't Put Critical Info in Headers/Footers

Many ATS systems skip header and footer content entirely. Your **name, phone number, and email should be in the main body** of the document.

### 10. Tailor Each Resume to the Job

A generic resume won't cut it. For each application:

- Adjust your summary to match the role
- Reorder your skills to prioritize what the job requires
- Modify bullet points to emphasize relevant experience

## How to Test Your Resume Against ATS

Before hitting submit, test your resume:

1. **Copy-paste test**: Copy your resume text and paste it into a plain text editor. If the structure falls apart, ATS will struggle too.
2. **Use an AI resume builder**: Tools like Pika Resume analyze your resume against job descriptions and suggest improvements.
3. **Check the job posting**: Look for specific keywords, requirements, and preferred qualifications.

## Common ATS Myths Debunked

**Myth: ATS only reads the first page**
Reality: ATS reads your entire document. A two-page resume is perfectly fine for experienced professionals.

**Myth: Fancy formatting helps you stand out**
Reality: It actually hurts you. Clean, simple formatting is always better for ATS.

**Myth: Once rejected by ATS, you can never reapply**
Reality: You can reapply with an optimized resume. Each application is typically evaluated independently.

## Final Thoughts

Writing an ATS-friendly resume doesn't mean sacrificing quality or personality. It means being **strategic about formatting, keywords, and structure** so that your qualifications shine through both to machines and humans.

The best approach? Start with an ATS-optimized template, tailor it to each job, and let your achievements do the talking. With the right strategy, your resume will make it past the digital gatekeepers and into the hands of the people who matter.
