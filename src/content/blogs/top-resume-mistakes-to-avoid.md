Your resume is your first impression — and in a competitive job market, it might be your only chance to make one. Recruiters spend an average of **6-7 seconds** scanning a resume before deciding whether to move forward or move on.

That means every word, every formatting choice, and every section of your resume needs to earn its place. Let's look at the ten most damaging resume mistakes and how to fix them.

## 1. Writing a Generic Resume for Every Job

The most common and most costly mistake. A one-size-fits-all resume signals to recruiters that you haven't taken the time to understand the role.

**The Fix:**
- Customize your professional summary for each application
- Mirror key phrases from the job description
- Prioritize relevant experience and skills for the specific role
- Adjust your bullet points to highlight applicable achievements

> "A tailored resume doesn't mean rewriting from scratch — it means strategically emphasizing the most relevant parts of your experience."

## 2. Focusing on Responsibilities Instead of Achievements

Listing what you were *responsible for* tells the recruiter nothing about your impact. They want to know what you *accomplished*.

**Bad example:**
- Responsible for managing social media accounts

**Good example:**
- Grew Instagram following from 5K to 50K in 8 months, increasing website traffic by 140%

### The STAR Method for Bullet Points

Use this framework for every accomplishment:

- **S**ituation: What was the context?
- **T**ask: What were you charged with?
- **A**ction: What did you specifically do?
- **R**esult: What was the measurable outcome?

## 3. Including an Objective Statement

Objective statements are outdated. They focus on what *you* want rather than what *you bring* to the company.

**Replace it with a Professional Summary:**

A 2-3 sentence summary that highlights your experience level, key skills, and what you bring to the table:

*"Results-driven marketing manager with 6+ years of experience in B2B SaaS. Proven track record of building content strategies that drive 3x organic traffic growth. Passionate about data-driven marketing and brand storytelling."*

## 4. Poor Formatting and Visual Clutter

If your resume is hard to read, it won't be read. Common formatting sins include:

- **Wall-of-text paragraphs** instead of bullet points
- **Inconsistent fonts** and spacing
- **Too many colors** or design elements
- **Cramming everything** onto one page with tiny margins

**The Fix:**
- Use 10-12pt font size for body text
- Maintain consistent margins (0.5" to 1" all around)
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs, for experience
- Limit yourself to 1-2 complementary fonts
- Leave enough white space for readability

## 5. Listing Outdated or Irrelevant Experience

That summer lifeguard job from 2010? Your high school GPA? These take up valuable space and signal a lack of awareness about what matters.

### What to Cut

- Jobs from **more than 10-15 years ago** (unless highly relevant)
- High school education (if you have a college degree)
- Irrelevant hobbies and interests
- Outdated technologies or skills
- References or "References available upon request"

### What to Keep

Focus on the **last 10 years** of relevant experience. If older experience is truly relevant, summarize it in a single line under "Earlier Career."

## 6. Typos and Grammatical Errors

It sounds basic, but **59% of recruiters** say they would reject a candidate based on typos alone. Spelling errors signal carelessness.

**Prevention checklist:**
- Run spell-check (but don't rely solely on it)
- Read your resume out loud
- Have a friend review it
- Use Grammarly or a similar tool
- Print it out — errors are easier to spot on paper

Common mistakes to watch for:
- "Manger" instead of "Manager"
- "Lead" vs. "Led" (tense consistency)
- Inconsistent capitalization
- Missing periods at the end of bullet points (or inconsistent punctuation)

## 7. Making Your Resume Too Long (or Too Short)

**One page** for early-career professionals (0-5 years of experience).
**Two pages** for mid-to-senior level professionals (5+ years).
**Three pages** only for executives, academics, or highly specialized roles.

Anything longer screams *"I don't know how to prioritize."*

If you're struggling to fit everything on the right number of pages, it's a sign you need to be more selective about what you include.

## 8. Using a Boring or Non-Descriptive Job Title Section

Your work experience titles should be immediately scannable. Recruiters look at:

1. **Company name** — is it recognizable?
2. **Job title** — does it match what they're hiring for?
3. **Dates** — how long were you there?
4. **Impact** — did you achieve anything notable?

Format each entry consistently:

**Senior Product Designer** | Spotify | March 2022 – Present

Don't bury the title in a paragraph or use vague descriptions like "Did various things at a startup."

## 9. Ignoring the Skills Section

Many candidates either skip the skills section entirely or fill it with vague terms like "team player" and "hard worker."

### Build a Strong Skills Section

**Technical Skills:**
- List tools, technologies, languages, and certifications
- Be specific: "Advanced Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Macros)" not just "Microsoft Office"

**Industry Skills:**
- Include domain-specific knowledge
- Mention methodologies (Agile, Six Sigma, Design Thinking)

**Languages:**
- Include spoken languages with proficiency levels

## 10. Not Including a Call to Action

Your resume should make it easy for the recruiter to take the next step. This doesn't mean a literal "call me!" — it means:

- **Clear contact information** at the top (email, phone, LinkedIn)
- **A LinkedIn profile** that's complete and matches your resume
- **Portfolio or website link** if applicable
- **Professional email address** (not coolboi2000@gmail.com)

## The Resume Review Checklist

Before you send out your next application, run through this quick checklist:

- [ ] Is it tailored to this specific job?
- [ ] Does every bullet point show impact, not just responsibility?
- [ ] Is the formatting clean and consistent?
- [ ] Have you included relevant keywords from the job posting?
- [ ] Is it free of typos and grammatical errors?
- [ ] Is it the right length for your experience level?
- [ ] Is your contact information complete and professional?
- [ ] Would a recruiter understand your value in 6 seconds?

## Wrapping Up

The difference between a resume that gets interviews and one that gets ignored often comes down to these fixable mistakes. Take the time to review and refine your resume — it's the highest-ROI career activity you can do.
